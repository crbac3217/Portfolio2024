                        For the announcement trailer of "Dragonkin: The Banished," I was heavily involved in an ambitious project that marked the studio's first fully in-engine trailer. This endeavor required us to start from scratchâ€”conceptualizing the trailer, designing levels, and compositing the final visuals entirely within the engine. Our team was also responsible for creating a range of new assets, including weapons, clothing, and animations, which added complexity and depth to our workflow.

                        My primary responsibilities encompassed creating and refining materials using Substance Painter and Mixer, which were essential for achieving the high-quality visuals we aimed for. I also managed the overall project and asset workflow, ensuring that all elements were cohesive and aligned with our vision for the trailer. Additionally, I tackled various technical challenges, including creating and modifying Niagara particles to enhance visual effects and crafting clothing assets in Marvelous Designer. After designing these assets, I was responsible for baking out the Alembics, which is crucial for preserving the high fidelity of the fabric simulations in our final renders.

                        Despite the demanding nature of this project, which often required our team to work overtime well past midnight, the experience was incredibly enriching. The hands-on challenges and the opportunity to deeply engage with advanced animation and rendering techniques provided me with invaluable learning experiences. "Dragonkin: The Banished" will remain one of the most memorable projects in my career, not only for the technical skills I developed but also for the teamwork and perseverance it demanded.
